Java File Naming Conventions
‚Ä¢	When writing a Java program, we should follow the below rules:
‚Ä¢	The file name must match with the public class name.
‚Ä¢	Java is case sensitive, so Geeks.java is not equal to geeks.java.
‚Ä¢	If a file has no "public" class, the file name can be anything but it should be matched with the primary class name.

```
// A Java program to print "Hello World" 
public class Geeks { 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello World"); 
    } 
}

// Output:"Hello World"
```
üßë‚Äçüíª Is JavaScript platform-independent like Java?
‚úÖ Yes, both JavaScript and Java are platform-independent, but they achieve it differently:
üî∏ Java ‚Äì "Write once, run anywhere"
Java code is compiled to bytecode.

Bytecode runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

The JVM is available for many platforms, making Java platform-independent.

‚úÖ Platform independence is provided by the JVM layer.

üî∏ JavaScript ‚Äì Runs inside browsers or engines
JavaScript is not compiled to bytecode first (traditionally).

It runs inside a JavaScript engine, like:

V8 (Chrome, Node.js)

SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

JavaScriptCore (Safari)

These engines are built into browsers or environments like Node.js.

‚úÖ Platform independence is provided by the browser or runtime environment.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparison:
Feature	Java	JavaScript
Runs on	JVM	Browser or JS Engine
Output of compilation	Bytecode	Interpreted or JIT-compiled scripts
Platform independence	Via JVM	Via browser/runtime
Typical usage	Backend, Android, enterprise apps	Web apps, server-side (Node.js)

‚úÖ So yes:
JavaScript is platform-independent ‚Äî as long as there is a JavaScript engine (like in a browser or Node.js), it will run the same code on any OS or device.

| Feature                 | **Java**                       | **JavaScript (Node.js)**                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Server-side support** | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., Spring Boot)      | ‚úÖ Yes (via Node.js)                     |
| **API building**        | ‚úÖ Widely used for REST APIs    | ‚úÖ Very common for REST APIs             |
| **Speed**               | Very fast (compiled + JIT)     | Fast (event-driven, non-blocking I/O)   |
| **Enterprise usage**    | ‚úÖ Dominates large companies    | Used more in startups and modern stacks |
| **Ecosystem maturity**  | ‚úÖ Mature, stable, huge tooling | Modern, growing fast, lightweight       |
| **Learning curve**      | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Steeper                     | ‚¨áÔ∏è Easier if you know JS already        |


üí£ What is a Buffer Overflow?
A buffer overflow happens when a program tries to write more data into a fixed-size block of memory (buffer) than it can hold.

When this happens, the extra data spills into nearby memory, potentially:

Overwriting important variables

Crashing the program

Or even letting an attacker inject malicious code

Key Features of Java
1. Platform Independent
Compiler converts source code to byte code and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This byte code can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of the byte code. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.

2. Object-Oriented Programming
Java is an object-oriented language, promoting the use of objects and classes. Organizing the program in the terms of a collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.

The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
3. Simplicity
Java‚Äôs syntax is simple and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++. It eliminates complex features like pointers and multiple inheritances, making it easier to write, debug, and maintain code.

4. Robustness
Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, exception handling, and memory allocation.

5. Security
In java, we don‚Äôt have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so. That‚Äôs why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also, java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure.

6. Distributed
We can create distributed applications using the java programming language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating distributed applications in java. The java programs can be easily distributed on one or more systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.

7. Multithreading 
Java supports multithreading, enabling the concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require high performance, such as games and real-time simulations.

8. Portability  
As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable. WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere) makes java application to generates a ‚Äò.class‚Äô file that corresponds to our applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides architecture-neutral ease, as bytecode is independent of any machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.

9. High Performance
Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some times java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basis where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute faster.


1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
The JVM is an integral part of the Java platform, responsible for executing Java bytecode. It ensures that the output of Java programs is consistent across different platforms.

Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.
The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.
In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is designed to run the bytecode generated by the Java compiler. Each operating system has its own version of the JVM, but all JVMs follow the same rules and standards. This means Java programs can run the same way on any device with a JVM, regardless of the operating system. This is why Java is called a platform-independent language.

2. Bytecode
Bytecode is the intermediate representation of Java code, generated by the Java compiler. It is platform-independent and can be executed by the JVM.

3. Java Development Kit(JDK)
While we were using the term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Debuggers, Java Docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.

4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.

5. Garbage Collector
In Java, programmers can‚Äôt delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of objects being referenced.

6. ClassPath
The Classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the classpath.

Basically everything in java is represented in Class as an object including the main function.

Advantages of Java
Platform independent: Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, which means that applications can be written once and run on any device.
Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it follows the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Security: Java has built-in security features that make it a secure platform for developing applications, such as automatic memory management and type checking.
Large community: Java has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a lot of support available for learning and using the language.
Enterprise-level applications: Java is widely used for developing enterprise-level applications, such as web applications, e-commerce systems, and database systems.
Disadvantages of Java
Performance: Java can be slower compared to other programming languages, such as C++, due to its use of a virtual machine and automatic memory management.
Memory management: Java's automatic memory management can lead to slower performance and increased memory usage, which can be a drawback for some applications.
