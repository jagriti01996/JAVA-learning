Java File Naming Conventions
•	When writing a Java program, we should follow the below rules:
•	The file name must match with the public class name.
•	Java is case sensitive, so Geeks.java is not equal to geeks.java.
•	If a file has no "public" class, the file name can be anything but it should be matched with the primary class name.

```
// A Java program to print "Hello World" 
public class Geeks { 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello World"); 
    } 
}

// Output:"Hello World"
```
